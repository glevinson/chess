Imperial MSc Computing: C++ coursework for a Chess engine

This project simulates all the possible moves in chess. The main program simulates some error moves before resetting and moving to a game between Alekhine and Vasic (1931), followed by resetting and playing a stalemate chess game. This project was the final C++ coursework as part of MSc Computing at Imperial College London.

To run the program, compile it using ```make``` and the run with ```./chess```
